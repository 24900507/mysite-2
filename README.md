change views.py code also according to the before process

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e197298-8392-4960-89c9-b472b5586acb)

in the code check this line
```
"Hello, world. c433ceb4 is the polls index."
```
for me the password is c433ceb4 make you u have the same or different if different change the (c433ceb4) and try

if not working changing the full code

by help of this code

```
cd mysite-2

vi views.py
```

```
press "I" for edit
```

```

after changing views.py press esc key and type

```
:wq
```

it will save automatically

now open urls.py with same process

```
vi urls.py
```

```
press "I" for edit
```

## urls.py

```
from django.urls import path

from . import views

app_name = 'polls'
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),
    path('owner/', views.owner, name='owner'),
    path('<int:pk>/', views.DetailView.as_view(), name='detail'),
    path('<int:pk>/results/', views.ResultsView.as_view(), name='results'),
    path('<int:question_id>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote'),
]
```

after changing urls.py press esc key and type
